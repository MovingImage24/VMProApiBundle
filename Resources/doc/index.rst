Getting started with VMPro API Bundle
=====================================

This Symfony bundle allows you to seamlessly integrate the MovingIMAGE Video
Manager Pro into your PHP application built on top of the Symfony framework.

Prerequisites
-------------

This version requires version 2.7+ or 3.0+ of the Symfony framework, and supports
version 5.* and 6.* of the Guzzle HTTP client. (it will use which ever one is
already present in your dependencies, or install the latest available version if
you don't already have Guzzle as a dependency).

Installation
------------

Installing this bundle is a quick and simple process that should only take a minute.

Install library with composer
_____________________________

First you have to install it using Composer:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ composer require movingimage/vmpro-api-bundle

Enable bundle
_____________

Enable the bundle in your kernel:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // app/AppKernel.php

    // ...
    class AppKernel extends Kernel
    {
        public function registerBundles()
        {
            $bundles = array(
                // ...

                new MovingImage\Bundle\VMProApiBundle(),
            );

            // ...
        }

        // ...
    }
    ```

Configuration
_____________

All you need is some basic configuration inside your ``app/config/config.yml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    vm_pro_api:
        base_url:      %vmpro_base_url%
        default_vm_id: %vmpro_vm_id%
        credentials:
            username:  %vmpro_username%
            password:  %vmpro_password%

Please note that you will have to either define the parameters (between the '%%'
in the example) in your own ``parameters.yml``, or exchange them with your
pre-existing parameters.

You may omit the ``base_url`` parameter, in which case it will default to the **production**
API base URL for Video Manager Pro.

``default_vm_id`` is an optional parameter, but useful to specify if you interact with
only a single video manager.

Testing API connection
----------------------

After following the installation steps, you can test whether the bundle is able to successfully
interact with the MovingIMAGE Video Manager Pro API.

For this to work, you will have to configure the ``default_vm_id`` parameter in your configuration.

You can use the console command to test your connection:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ./bin/console vmpro-api:test-connection

If the connection was successful, you should see this:

.. code-block:: bash

    âœ” Connecting with the API succeeded.

Next steps
----------

After successful installation, you will probably want to use the bundle in your application.

Take a look at which `Services <services.rst>`_ are available through the dependency injection container.
